# BLUS30192 DemonWare ELF APIs and Tables

This page is an address-qualified map of the DemonWare code embedded in the
canonical BLUS30192 executables. MP and SP addresses are separate columns on
purpose. A blank cell means the function has not been independently identified
in that image.

Confidence:

- **confirmed** — exact serializer/control flow, RTTI/vtable, retained source
  evidence, or a verified runtime call path;
- **high** — strong structural identity retained with a `_candidate` suffix;
- **candidate** — unresolved identity that should not be treated as an API
  name.

## PS3 function descriptors

PPU code pointers frequently refer to an eight-byte function descriptor rather
than directly to the instruction address:

```text
descriptor +0x00  code address
descriptor +0x04  TOC address loaded into r2
```

For MP, mapped DemonWare descriptors use TOC `0x00897620`. For SP they use
`0x008DAD48`. Copying only a code address into another image loses the required
TOC context.

## Legacy bit buffer

These entries were independently decompiled in both MP and SP even where their
virtual addresses happen to match.

## Authentication and cryptography (MP image)

The authentication map is currently proven in `BLUS30192-mp.ELF`. Do not
apply these addresses to SP without independent verification.

Retained GNU RTTI names independently identify `bdCypher3Des` at
`0x00720D90`, `bdHashTiger192` at `0x00720E90`, `bdAuthService` at
`0x0072A060`, and `bdPS3AuthInfo` at `0x0072ABB0`.

### `bdAuthService` partial layout

The object is `0x124` bytes in the mapped constructor at MP `0x000870D8`.

| Offset | Field/evidence |
| ---: | --- |
| `+0x10` | active `bdLobbyConnection*` |
| `+0x18` | shared destination-address object |
| `+0x24` | embedded auth/result object |
| `+0x2C` | start of the separately retained 128-byte LSG token |
| `+0xAC` | 24-byte lobby key as viewed from `bdAuthService` |
| `+0xC8` | 24-byte clear PS3 auth cookie |

## Storage APIs

### Low-level task serializers

| Operation | Service/task | MP | SP | Confidence |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| upload named file | `10/1` | `0x00084C88` | `0x00084578` | confirmed |
| update existing file | `10/2` | `0x00085540` | `0x00084E30` | high |

The SP serializers call `0x00081248
bdRemoteTaskManager_startTask_candidate`. The MP serializers call the separate
MP entry at `0x00081548`.

### Game-side storage wrappers

| Operation | MP | SP | Confidence |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| start user-file upload | `0x0047B3B8` | `0x0036E168` | confirmed |

Both game images use 32 live task slots of `0x18` bytes. The pump selects
task 1 for a new file and task 2 after an existing `u64` file ID is known.

### Storage result objects

| Result API | MP | SP | Confidence |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `bdListFilesResult_deserialize` | `0x000837A0` | `0x00083090` | confirmed |

| `+0xA8` | 4 | file size/capacity |

`bdLobbyFile` extends this header with a data pointer at `+0xAC` and an
ownership byte at `+0xB0`.

## Stats and leaderboards

| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| `bdStatsInfo_deserialize` | `0x00082BB0` | `0x000826D0` | confirmed | Entity ID, rating, rank, name base |
| four-column row deserialize | `0x002100E8` | `0x00336490` | confirmed | Base plus four signed columns at `+0x64..+0x70` |
| ten-column row deserialize | `0x00442A10` | `0x00336C78` | confirmed | Base plus ten signed columns at `+0x64..+0x88` |
| four-column row serialize | — | `0x00333FC8` | confirmed | Rating base plus four signed columns |
| ten-column row serialize | — | `0x003360F0` | confirmed | Rating base plus ten signed columns |
| leaderboard page deserialize | `0x00440378` | — | confirmed | Reads total available then the envelope-supplied row count |
| refresh leaderboard page | `0x00440890` | — | confirmed | Starts task 4 entity read or task 5 pivot/rank read |
| counted-result parser | `0x00077580` | — | confirmed | Accepts discriminators 1, 4, or 5 and reads row count |

MP `0x00081C28` starts service 4 task 10, and MP `0x00082F00` writes each
bulk row's ID, entity ID, one byte, virtual field count, and concrete row
serializer. SP captures prove task 10 repeats rows without a top-level count.

The task ID does not uniquely select the concrete row type: SP solo Zombies
has sent service 4 task 1 with a four-column board-1023 row.

## KeyArchive and title utilities (MP image)

external six-byte `bdAddr`, and one NAT-type byte.

## Bandwidth-test client

Service 18 uses the raw-task starter rather than ordinary typed request fields.
